# HEX: Hybrid-EMT-Xray Navigation #

Navigating with continuous X-ray provides visual guidance, but exposes both surgeon and patient to ionizing radiation, which is associated with serious health risks. Interleaving fluoro snapshots with electromagnetic tracking (EMT) potentially minimizes radiation.
**HEX** (Hybrid EMT + X-ray) is a research framework for navigation with an emphasis on safe experimentation.
This framework is based on several hardware and software components that are orchestrated to allow for safe and efficient data acquisition.
